# Testing out Github Actions
I'd like to see if I can publish to Write.as using [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions). I am using [this repo](https://github.com/cjeller1592/writeas-github-action) to do it. The magic is in the containers in the cloud that do all of the CI/CD magic. It seems _really_ cool.

## I'm writing this in Visual Studio Code

### I make a commit

_And it's published!_

Isn't that *neat*?

# I think so...
